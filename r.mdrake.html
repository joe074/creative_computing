	And still, after <span class="poem">EVERYTHING</span> <br>
	i've been through, I still didn't understand<br>myself, for every time someone left, <br>  I caught myself <span class="decor">chasing</span>  after them and <br> every time someone stayed, I caught <br>myself ignoring them. And there was <br> never a <span class="decor">balance</span>  between the two. The <br> more they took, the more I gave and the <br>more they gave, the less I took. People <br> are strange, they <span class="bold">never want</span> what is <br> given to them and they always want <br>what they 
	<span class="poem">DON'T</span> deserve. <br>
